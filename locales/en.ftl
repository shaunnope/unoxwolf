    <strong>Gameplay</strong>
    At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role and a predetermined number of roles are left unassigned (<em>default: 3</em>).

    The game progresses in phases, during which players with certain roles may perform actions. Some actions result in changes to the role assignment. Hence, when day breaks, players may not be who they think they are.

    Within each phase, role actions are performed in a specific order. The phases and order of actions are as follows:

    .copy = <strong>Copy Phase</strong>
    .night = <strong>Night Phase</strong>
    .passive =
        <strong>Passive Roles</strong>
        The following roles do not perform actions that need to be resolved in a specific order.
